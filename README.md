# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions for the AOC 2024.

More info about Advent of Code can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

## How to use

Run the script with a prompt to select a day
```bash
npm run start:day 
```

Run with the first day pre selected
```bash
npm run start:day -- 1
```

Create a new day script and supporting files using [plop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plop)
```bash
npm run create:day 
```
